      <p>So, like many other people, I've been using this time of quarantine to fill my social void with something creative, and also to help stave off the ever present insanity monster that is lurking in my hall closet. This song and video are the result.</p>

      <p>Additionally, I wanted to share a bit about my inspiration for the song and video and also, some of my own experience with quarantine and how it's been affecting me.</p>

      <h2 class="headline">Me, myself, and Isolation</h2>

      <p>I'm by no means an extrovert, or an overly social person. In fact, I've always thought of myself as introverted to a point. As an only child, I seem to do quite well by myself and over the years I've realized that I relish my "me" time more than I had previously thought when I was younger.</p>

      <p>So, when all this quarantine business first started, I thought, "How bad can it be? Right? Working from home for the next three weeks sounds awesome!"</p>

      <p>Wrong. Well, we all know now that "three weeks" couldn't have been further from reality. And you don't realize just how much quarantine sucks until, one by one, you discover all the things that are now quite different than they used to be, or have even ceased to be things all together.</p>

      <p>I also quickly learned that a week was about my limit for isolation. By the end of the first fully isolated work week, the weekend hit, and I realized that I hadn't left my house all week. And as a result, I hand't seen or spoken to a single person in the flesh for the last seven days.</p>

      <p>I was itching to get out of the house and do some normal weekend things. You know, maybe have some drinks with some friends down at the bar? Nope. Just me, myself, the couch, Netflix, and whatever twelve pack of beer I happened to have in the fridge. This of course sounds like a great way to spend a weekend given normal circumstances, but when you're not doing it out of your own free will and instead are staring down a barrel of isolation that goes on for an unforeseeable length, shit suddenly becomes quite stark.</p>


      <p>Fast forward another week or two and I began to realize that all of this isolation has shown me that I do in fact crave not just human interaction, but also social interaction. Both in my personal and professional life. Like everything in the universe, there needs to be a certain level of balance, and right now the balance of my social and anti-social life looks like a hippopotamus and a squirrel on a seesaw.</p>

      <h2 class="headline">Inspiration</h2>

      <p>With my new found isolation and extra abundance of free time, I looked towards my music to keep me occupied. I figured it was a great time to learn some new things and to get a bunch of practice in.</p>

      <p>Not long into the quarantine, I noticed the creative bubble that was forming and being shared out over the internet by all kinds of people from around the world. I thought it would be fun to try and do a song of my own.</p>

      <p>As I started thinking about the subject matter for it, my mind was almost immediately drawn to the social media feeds that had been acting as a porthole into the outside world for me the last few weeks. So many people—friends, family, acquaintances—were all sharing out so many different things, all related to quarantine life. They were expressing things like their fears over suddenly being jobless, being locked inside with their kids all day, what kinds of things they were using as coping mechanisms, what they were eating, their bathing and sleeping habits, and so much more. The list went on.</p>

      <p>All of that, in addition to my own observations of the effects isolation was having on me personally, really resonated with me. I felt that I wanted to be able to put something together that captured all of those fears and emotions and share it with people so that it might give them something they might be able to relate to. Something that maybe might help them (and also me) realize that even though we're isolated, we're not alone. And even though everyone's situation is different, we're all battling our individual fears.</p>

      <p>This inspiration meant a lot to me, and I really wanted to share it with people, so I summed it up at the end of the video with a short statement:</p>

      <blockquote class="quote">
        <p>Inspired by everyone I know, and their individual situations,
        fears, senses of humor, and coping mechanisms through
        all of this. Including my own.</p>

<p>
        Through my social media feeds, I have been able to see
        all of this unfolding on a daily basis, and as a result it has
        made me feel like I'm not just alone, with myself, in isolation.
</p>

<p>
        So, thanks everyone, for sharing. It's helped to keep me sane.
</p>

<p>
        Hopefully this video will return some of the favor.

        <p>So, thank you everyone, and just try to hang the fuck on!</p>
